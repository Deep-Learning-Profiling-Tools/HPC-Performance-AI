# ENERGY

Six-kernel hydrodynamics EOS energy update sequence (upstream Base_CUDA variant).

## Source

Source suite: RAJAPerf (src/apps/ENERGY.*)
Upstream repository: https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf
Upstream commit: b0f1cd36afd7c2ac57fcb1dc676012be28fb1327

## Verified Environment

GCC/G++ 13.3.0 (conda, pinned) | C++20 | CMake 3.28.4 | Ninja 1.13.2 | Python 3.12.3
CUDA Toolkit 13.2 (nvcc 13.2.78, /usr/local/cuda) | NVIDIA B200 (sm_100), driver 595.58.03
HIP/ROCm: source + build config present where noted, unverified (no AMD GPU available)

Reproduce the toolchain from the repository root: `./setup_env.sh` then
`source hpcperf_env.sh` (all user-space versions are pinned in environment.yml).

## Backends

CUDA: working (configure + build + run + validation verified on B200)
HIP: extracted, untested (no AMD GPU / ROCm on the development machine)

## Build

```bash
source hpcperf_env.sh
cmake -S level1/energy -B build/energy/cuda -DBACKEND=CUDA -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/energy/cuda
```

HIP (build configuration present, unverified without ROCm):

```bash
cmake -S level1/energy -B build/energy/hip -DBACKEND=HIP -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/energy/hip
```

## Run

```bash
./build/energy/cuda/energy_cuda
```

## Validation

Frozen golden reference ([tools/golden](../../tools/golden/hpcperf_golden.py)): every run captures the checked outputs `e_new`, `q_new` (f64[size] each) and `hpcperf_golden.py check` compares them with the frozen B200 golden reference `reference/<input_id>.json` by the driver's own rule, max |g - r| / (1 + |r|) <= 1e-10 minus the B200 output's own deviation from the CPU reference (measured when the golden was frozen). The added driver's CPU reference (upstream Base_Seq variant with identical data initialization, compared element-wise, rel tol 1e-10, PASS/FAIL) runs only on the explicit offline request `HPCPERF_CPU_REFERENCE=1`, which `hpcperf_golden.py make` uses once to validate the golden.

Run it via (one plain run of the registry's default input, then the golden check):

```bash
ctest --test-dir build/energy/cuda --output-on-failure
```

**Correctness switch.** By default the CPU reference is skipped: the benchmark prints `SKIP_VERIFY` (never PASS) and exits 0, so ctest, `tools/inputs` and `tools/timing` never run it and nothing falls back to it. `HPCPERF_CPU_REFERENCE=1` runs it (offline only; `HPCPERF_SKIP_VERIFY=1` still forces the skip); `HPCPERF_GOLDEN_DUMP=<dir>` captures the outputs ([tools/golden/hpcperf_golden.h](../../tools/golden/hpcperf_golden.h)).

**Measurement markers.** The region of interest `tools/timing` measures is marked with `hpcperf_roi.h` in `cuda/main.cu` and the HIP port: the timed repetition loop. Pure insertions; a no-op unless measuring, so ctest is unaffected. Placement rule: [tools/timing/roi/README.md](../../tools/timing/roi/README.md).
